# Dynamic DLL Loader in C#

A simple application that loads C# DLL's at runtime with all of it's dependencies (even Nuget packages examples provided) using Reflection.
The code written in .Net 8.0 and, I guess it would work in older versions as well.

## Disclaimer ⚠: Code is not clean and may not be performant.
